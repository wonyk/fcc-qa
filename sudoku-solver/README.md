This project is a web-based Sudoku Solver that utilises the backtracking algorithm.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank W3Schools and MDN for their easy to understand guides that are easily accessible online. They helped me greatly while trying to improve on the UI of this project.

Moreover, thanks to [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sudoku-backtracking-7/) for their awesome tutorial which provided assistance for my work.

Next, I would also like to thank Kognise for maintaining the beautiful and simple [Water.CSS](https://watercss.kognise.dev/) file as well as [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for the automatic CSS formatting.

Lastly, kudos to [Sudoku.jl](https://github.com/hayd/Sudoku.jl/) for their **easy50.txt** Sudoku templates which I had adapted to keep only 40 of them to randomise during page refreshes.

### Supported Browsers

This project is tested working on Firefox 79.0+ (beta), Chrome 83+ and Edge 83+ (Chromium).

However, IE is not supported because ES6 / ES7 features are used in the javascript. Babel is included but the CSS parsing does not support IE.

Please contact me should there be any discrepancies found.
