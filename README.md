## American - British Translator

This project allows users to translate American English to British English and vice versa. It uses the word list that comes loaded with the project.

It has completed all the requirements of the FCC [Quality Assurance Projects - American British Translator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/american-british-translator) project.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank W3Schools and MDN for their easy to understand guides that are easily accessible online. They helped me greatly while trying to improve on the UI of this project.

Moreover, thanks to [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for the automatic CSS formatting.

Next, I would also like to thank Angelos Chalaris for creating [mini.css](https://minicss.org/docs#getting-started). It has simplfied many of my development work by providing grids and elegant designs.

### Supported Browsers

This project is tested working on Firefox 79.0+ (beta), Chrome 83+ and Edge 83+ (Chromium).

However, IE is not supported because ES6 / ES7 features are used in the javascript. Moreover, mini.css is not optimised for IE.

Please contact me should there be any discrepancies found.
