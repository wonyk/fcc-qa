## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank MDN and W3Schools (as usual) for their helpful jQuery, HTML, CSS and JS guides. They serve as quick bite-sized refresher tutorials for
jQuery which is used mainly in this project.

Next, I am grateful to all the online guides for their help - especially for the web development part which I had not practiced in a while.

## Getting Started

```
1. Git clone or simply download this project
2. Ensure you have NodeJS v10 and above
3. npm install
4. To run tests, you can set NODE_ENV=test in your .env file
5. npm start
```

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 75.0+ (beta), Chrome 80+, Edge 44+, IE9 and above. (Functionality)

For CSS support, proper CSS renders for IE only works on version 11. Most modern browsers should support all the CSS
functionalities used.

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
