## Issue Tracker

This project is a self-made all-usage issue tracker that can be used by anyone. Ideally, the application is best used by a single
person since anyone who had access to the internet can edit any issue with full privileges.

This project has fulfilled all the requirements of FCC [Quality Assurance Projects - Issue Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/issue-tracker)
and has gone through back-end integration tests.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank MDN and W3Schools for their great guides for this Full-Stack development journey. They had assist me in areas ranging from HTML and CSS to Regex
and jQuery.

Also, I am grateful to [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for their simple and clean interface as well as documentation to make this project painless.

### Browser Support

This project has been tested to work on Firefox 75.0+ (beta), Chrome 80+, Edge 44.1+ in terms of functionality.

Unfortunately, IE is not supported due to the use of ES6 and ES7 JS, without polyfill.

This information is correct as of the date of publish. Please contact me if there are any discrepancies.
